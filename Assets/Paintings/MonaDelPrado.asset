  p_Description: "The Prado Mona Lisa is a painting by the workshop of Leonardo da
    Vinci and depicts the same subject and composition as Leonardo's better known
    Mona Lisa at the Louvre, Paris. The Prado Mona Lisa has been in the collection
    of the Museo del Prado in Madrid, Spain since 1819, but was considered for decades
    a relatively unimportant copy. Following its restoration in 2012, however, the
    Prado's Mona Lisa has come to be understood as the earliest known studio copy
    of Leonardo's masterpiece.\r\nAlthough there are dozens of surviving copies of
    the Mona Lisa from the 16th and 17th centuries, the Prado's Mona Lisa may have
    been painted simultaneously by a student of Leonardo in the same studio where
    he painted his own Mona Lisa, so it is said to be the copy with the most historical
    value. Among the pupils of Leonardo, Sala\xEC or Francesco Melzi are the most
    plausible authors of the Prado's version, though other experts argue that the
    painting could have been executed by one of Leonardo's Spanish students.\r\n"
