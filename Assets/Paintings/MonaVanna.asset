  p_Description: "A student and companion of Leonardo da Vinci known as Sala\xEC
    painted one of the nude interpretations of Mona Lisa known, titled Mona Vanna.
    Salai's version is thought by some to have been \"based on\" the nude sometimes
    attributed to Leonardo, which is considered a lost work. Discussion among experts
    exists as to whether Salai, known to have modeled for Leonardo, may in fact have
    been the sitter represented in the original Mona Lisa."
