  p_Description: "By the 20th century, Mona Lisa had already been a victim of satirical
    embellishment. Sapeck (Eug\xE8ne Bataille), in 1883, depicted Mona Lisa smoking
    a pipe. Titled Le Rire (The Laugh), the artwork was displayed at the \"Incoherents\"
    exhibition in Paris at the time of its creation, making it among the earliest
    known instances of Mona Lisa's image being re-interpreted using contemporary
    irony."
